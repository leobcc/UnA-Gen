# UnA-Gen

UnA-Gen is a 3D Human reconstruction model from monocular videos. The model is designed to be trained fully unsupervised, with the objective of being able to train the model on a wide variety of humans, body types, clothes, and garments. </br>
The pre-trained model can be run on a novel video to produce a fast reconstruction of the clothed human, both in the dynamical and canonical space, relying on its previous training. However, the model can perform a fast refinement over the specific video to optimize the reconstruction. 

## Disclaimer

This is currently a work in progress, part of a research effort conducted in collaboration with the University of Barcelona. The complete code implementation will soon be available in this repository.
